I'm a security engineer who specializes in incident response, digital forensics, and other areas pertaining to cyber security. I have a degree in Digital Forensics as well as many certifications that you likely don't care about (and yet I still pay annual fees). Why did I create this site? Because I've visited Stack Overflow way too many times in search of answers that I hope can help you. Drop me a message if you have any comments on my pages - or if you'd like assistance in any of the topics mentioned on this site.
